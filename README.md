Google Developer Group Events
=============================

This app will show different Google Developer Group Events, encouraging the
user to participate in one. This is accomplished by putting the user
into the position of a participant of former events, by letting them view
a photosphere of those.

Increased immersion can be achieved by using a Cardboard or compatible device.


Play Store
==========

As soon as we have published the apk, we will put a link here, so you can enjoy
its features, without compiling it.



Source Code
===========

This source code is provided as-is. Do not expect any changes, but we'll try
to keep it up and running. What you can expect is more content over the curse
of time.

Feedback is always welcome, so please feel free to drop a line, or leave an
issue here, on github. Also pull requests are always welcome.
